# APPLIED-SCIENCE-1
This Assignment assesses the following module Learning Outcomes (from Definitive Module Document):

1. Be able to maintain and develop code using the git version control system.

2. Be able to apply different techniques for cleaning data and preparing it for analysis.

3. Be able to communicate their findings to others, including a critical assessment of performance.

4. Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the concepts of version control for code development.

5. Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of key data manipulation techniques for data preparation.

6. Understand how to approach a range of different data science problems to obtain an efficient solution.

Assignment Tasks: 

You will create a well-written report exploring and explaining any relations within a dataset. You can download any dataset from Kaggle/Worldbank/etc. Be sure to include your name, student number and a link to your GitHub repository in the report. There will be at least three plots: a histogram/bar chart/pie chart; a line/scatter graph; a confusion matrix/heatmap/corner/box/violin plot. The code will contain evidence of the creation of any displayed graphs (one graph per function) and the creation of any quoted statistic. The minimum expected statistic is the use of a pandas dataframe describe and corr.

Note: You may be asked to attend a viva if there are suspicions of derivative work, i.e., collusion (submitting near-identical work at any quantities); plagiarism (using someone else's work, including from online); or the use of generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT). If you do not attend this viva, the grade for the relevant work will be 0.

Submission Requirements:

 A two page PDF report, including a functional link to your GitHub repository containing your python code (either notebooks or plain python). Check that your repository link is both clickable and links to a public repository. The plots must be in the report to be marked, not within the notebook. Do not waste space in the report with trivial content such as how you downloaded and read a file. The prose should flow as: short introduction to the topic; discussion on what the first plot is showing, using statistics and describing the distributions; then same for second plot then third plot.
